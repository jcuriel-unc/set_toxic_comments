I think that you should either have the students read the material and practice in class or teach the material and give homework. The homework certainly shouldn't be due the day that we review the material in class because if we don't understand it then we are forced to correct our homework in class, which leads to a rushed job. Also, if we do the homework before we clear up any misconceptions from reading the material and we aren't able to correct it before we turn in, then we won't have an actual representation on how much we understand the material, so we won't know if we need to review on certain topics.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.029563503,0.001001358,0.0154929245,0,0.030564861,0,3510,0

It felt that theory areas (often important for political science) were largely ignored in favor of purely quantitative work.

1874,507,"OHIO NORTHERN UNIVERSITY","I have three things: 1) Professor likes to make connections with other topics, which is lovely, but I think he assumes legal educations are more standardized than they are in practice. For example, one time he was trying to connect with a Civil Procedure principle that we were taught as _domicile,_ but he was looking for a different word (I don't remember much), so it looked like we just didn't know. Also, sometimes you forget things and then relearn them for the bar, and that's okay. I think the connection is good, but the expectations involved could be more flexible. 2) I really appreciate that Professor Baez tries to foster discussion, but I think sometimes he gets dissapointed if we don't come up with a bunch of different answers (like, recently we've been covering amortization and like-kind exchanges with number answers, and he'll want to put a bunch of numbers on the board, but we only come up with 2 or 3, and one of them is typically right, so I think he doesn't need to push so hard to get a diversity of answers. Although, teaching a class without a lot of response from students is also difficult). 3) Also, Professor Baez sometimes makes a mistake that I feel like is common with well-organized professors who rely on lots of class back-and-forth: Sometimes he's looking for an answer, and so he doesn't hear the student's whole answer, or quite register what they said. So, like, if he's looking for an answer but wants to talk about it one step at a time, but a student gives the full answer right away, he might latch on to the part he was looking for or recognizes first, and ask the student the next part. The student then assumes that part of what they said was wrong and has to search for another answer, and it feels awkward.

209,732,"OHIO NORTHERN UNIVERSITY","This course was very poorly executed. 1.) The course followed the flipped classroom methodology, but why? The entire course from day one was set up so that the responsibility of getting and digesting the material was placed squarely on the student (The flipped classroom methodology) and class time was only used for review of what the student should have taught themselves (in some cases in relatively shallow detail relative the level presented in the chapter or needed for the HW) and reviewing the homework if there were specific questions that someone had. I'm unsure why this approach was taken as it put a lot of work on the student to get and digest the information in addition to doing the immense amount of homework assigned almost every class (More on this in another section). To be frank, if I was interested in the topic of logic, I could have purchased the textbook and worked through it in my spare time and gotten an equivalent if not better education than I did by taking this course (As this was essentially all the course was), with the added benefit of getting to choose the amount of work I did or was needed to understand a given topic. 2.) Far too much homework In total, we were assigned 1,179 required problems for homework throughout the course, which correlates to an average of 84.21 problems per week (excluding weeks 9 and 14 which were midterms and break respectively), where the max assigned in a single week was 159 problems. This workload is further compounded by the fact that the chapter readings were assigned to be done by the student before each class in addition to all quizzes being done outside of class (To his credit, when the problems per week are graphed, a decline can be noticed in correlation to when quizzes are assigned). It is my understanding that the professor was approached by several students saying that the workload was a little intense and asking for him to consider reducing it, to which he said that he would. The workload was never reduced. I understand that mastery requires practice, but at what point does practice become beating a dead horse? The defense will be that if there were a lot of questions then they were short, but how this is simply not the case, and even if it were, there is still a non-trivial amount of time associated with doing them in addition to the other responsibilities of the class. 3.) Poor use of class time This was touched on some in the previous sections but class time ideally should have been used to lecture over the material that was expected to be learned by the student in enough depth that the homework was doable (rather than relying on the student to essentially teach it to themselves) and for quizzes (If they're take-home, homework should have been paused) and exams (Ideally would have fit into 1 class period but not overly problematic that they didn't). These problems ultimately lead to not reading the chapters in depth like I had in the beginning and only skimming them to answer specific questions, trying to get the homework done as quickly as possible as I viewed it as a chore once I got past the point of feeling like it was sufficient to learn the material (typically happened in 7 to 12 questions), and not being overly motivated to go to class (typically only 4 or 5 people regularly showed up to class out of a class of 9 or so) as I felt that I wouldn't gain much from the shallow coverage of the material that would be offered after doing the 20-50 questions of homework or that I should instead use that time to get caught up on homework I had fallen behind on.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.5,0,0.062236045,0.0019073486,0.026444806,0,0.0641433936,0,4005,0

VERY helpful to slow down lecture a bit and help each other as peers.

It was difficult to find time to find SOLID research outside of class.

The thing I disliked about this course was the amount of workload outside of class because I do understand that there will always be work outside of the classroom but the amount was almost too much especially when most of it had to be done with your whole team. This made it difficult especially with everyone having unique schedules and a with the group projects, the professors were also adding homework assignments, videos, and readings on top of all of that. I think that if the time in class could be given more often to project work time or individual work time that would be very beneficial.Also going deeper into what is on the content exam and to have days to review in class would be amazing because the content exam was information from the beginning of the year that I did not remember how to do.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.045131154,0.0015926361,0.020837102,0,0.0467237901,0,4895,0

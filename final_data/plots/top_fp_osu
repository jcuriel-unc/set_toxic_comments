<tr><td colspan="2" style="border-bottom: 1px solid black"></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left">take your next class with prof !! she's awesome...always ends class 15 mins early, puts all notes up on power point. only 3 homework assignments and 3 exams. the homework was quite easy, and the exams are all 50 mc questions. her wording can be a bit misleading, but if you get less than a B you're an idiot</td><td>0.707</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left">ok, so this class all depends on the students that are in it. Ive heard some really cringey comments in this class. since he offers credit for participation youll have a lot of annoying freshmen trying to kiss his ass. grading is very vague. class isnt easy, but the prof is very likable.</td><td>0.637</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left">She's very fair. I got away with calling Karl Marx and idiot and still got an A or A-. Don't be a child and you will be fine.</td><td>0.624</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left">Whoever says she is bad is wrong. Dr is a really good teacher and her class is easy unless you are an idiot. She explains everything very well in class and anything you dont understand can be found in the book or you can ask and she's very helpful.</td><td>0.621</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left">The lectures are very boring bring other homework or classwork to do instead. Tests are extremely difficult if you do not completely understand or read the book. Very nice professor, the class just sucks.</td><td>0.607</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left">The fans understand his stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate him, to realise that he says something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldnt appreciate, for instance, the humour in existential catchphrase "it's a feature not a bug."</td><td>0.605</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left">You can tell Prof. really knows what he talks about and that he is truly fascinated by psychology. With that being said this whole class was based on 3 big group assignments which sucks. Luckily I got a good group but if your group sucks you're screwed. There are open note quizzes and a cumulative final. Attendance mandatory on group days.</td><td>0.551</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left">You learn so much from Dr. if you actually do the things youre supposed to do. If you dont, the class is hard and would definitely suck</td><td>0.546</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left">While this class is not easy, it is worth the effort. is extremely intelligent and he is full of info. I think he communicates the material clearly and his examples stick in your mind. He does not hand out grades, you have to earn them. I got an A by reading all of the material, attending every class and studying my ass off.</td><td>0.546</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left">loved the class, worked her ass off for this, but she also put a lot of pressure on us, and at times, i think she was a little over the top. she just needs to relax and do some yoga or something sometimes. :)</td><td>0.528</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left">its only the 2nd month of classes and this class is extremely hard I'm very lost the final research paper is on strikes and thats what the class is based on, I already want to drop it. Recitation sucks as well</td><td>0.528</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left">Make you read and memorize many junk research articles for exam. Those articles are not very informative and some of these research play around with number and graph makes the result seems significant. Just Awful!</td><td>0.489</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left">Tests are ridiculous, he doesnt prepare you for them at all.</td><td>0.451</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left">HE'S THE GOAT!!!</td><td>0.425</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left">Typically if you do not come to class, you're screwed. Most of the exams, even when studied for, were difficult. Also has a weird grading system and quizzes/homework are a low percent of the grade.</td><td>0.419</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left">GOAT in human form. I truly do not know why this professor doesn't have a perfect rating. He is knowledgeable about the content and truly cares about his students. Dr. is a paragon of virtue among a sea of miserable, overworked, and on-edge professors.</td><td>0.418</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left">Really, great guy, great class. Those claiming he is biased are absolutely ridiculous, you can be conservative as you want and the guy is respectful. Easy, fun, and informative. Take him if you can.</td><td>0.406</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left">IF YOU DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS YOU SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GRADUATE AS A PSYCH DEGREE</td><td>0.404</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left">This class is dumb easy. Only grades are the midterm and final, but he gives you the questions beforehand and only makes you write a response for 1 or 2 of them. He also gives you the answers to all the questions the lecture before both exams. Dr is very knowledgeable and decently funny, so lectures arent bad either</td><td>0.403</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left">Fabulous teacher. SO difficult, but made my whole experience at OSU worth it. He will challenge you to your limits. He seems curt sometimes, but he is really nice, just not the best at expressing it. Be prepared to be called on in class to answer impossible questions. Don't take his classes if you aren't willing to work your butt off for an A!</td><td>0.400</td></tr>
